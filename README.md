Employee turnover is expensive and disruptive. Using a dataset from Salifort Motors, this project follows a structured approach:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Model training: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Model evaluation using precision, recall, F1 score, ROC
- Business insights based on feature importance




Tools used:
- Python: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, NumPy  
- Modeling: scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, DecisionTree, RandomForest)  
- Notebook: Jupyter
